⭐ PROJECT TITLE:

Enterprise Client & Project Management Admin Dashboard


---

⭐ PROJECT OVERVIEW (BRIEF & PROFESSIONAL)

The Enterprise Client & Project Management Admin Dashboard is a fully responsive, frontend-only web application created to simulate the internal admin panel used by IT companies for managing clients, projects, team activities, and daily operations.

The dashboard focuses on UI development, modern design, and clean layout structuring, built using the core web technologies:

✔ HTML

✔ CSS

✔ JavaScript

✔ Bootstrap

All data displayed across the dashboard (cards, tables, charts) is sample/static data, which is normal practice in UI development and internship-level work, since companies do not share real business data.


---

⭐ TECHNOLOGIES USED

Frontend

HTML5 – Structure of all pages

CSS3 – Styling, colors, layout, custom design elements

Bootstrap 5 – Grid system, responsive design, cards, navigation

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Interactivity, active states, chart functions

Chart.js (optional if included) – Simple bar/pie/line charts for analytics

Bootstrap Icons / Material Icons – Icons across sidebar and cards


Data

Static JSON / Inline JS objects – To simulate real company data


No backend (No database used)

This is a pure UI/UX web project, common for frontend developers and interns.
